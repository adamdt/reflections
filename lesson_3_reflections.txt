1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Remote repositories could be used to access your code from more than one workstation
	and/or to allow multiple people to access/update your code without having to manually
	send/receive files.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manually pulling changes ensures that you only change the contents of your local
	repository when you want to, rather than potentially pulling changes to the code you're
	working on without you realizing or wanting it. For instance, if you're working on a
	collaborative project and updating a feature, but someone else pushes an update that
	could break your code, you'd want to make sure that you were aware of that before you
	pulled that update to your local repository, probably after you had finished your
	feature update.
