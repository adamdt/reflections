1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Remote repositories could be used to access your code from more than one workstation
	and/or to allow multiple people to access/update your code without having to manually
	send/receive files.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manually pulling changes ensures that you only change the contents of your local
	repository when you want to, rather than potentially pulling changes to the code
	you're working on without you realizing or wanting it. For instance, if you're working
	on a collaborative project and updating a feature, but someone else pushes an update
	that could break your code, you'd want to make sure that you were aware of that before
	you pulled that update to your local repository, probably after you had finished your
	feature update.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

	A fork is a clone of a repository on GitHub to another account on GitHub. You'd use it
	if you wanted to make changes to a repository that you didn't have permission to edit.
	A clone is a copy of a repository on GitHub or a local machine to another location.
	You'd use it if you wanted to work on a GitHub repository on your local machine or
	create a copy of a repository on your local machine in another location. A branch is a
	set of commits that goes in a different direction from the main version of the project.
	You'd use it if you wanted to make a new feature or fix a bug while retaining a working
	copy of the project.
